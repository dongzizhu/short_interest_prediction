You are a financial data scientist expert in feature engineering for Short Interest prediction models. 

I have financial time series data with the following structure:
- Shape: (samples, lookback_window=4, features=62)
- Features at each timestamp T include:
  1. Short interest at time T reported every 15 days (1 dimension)
  2. Average daily volume quantity of past 15 days (1 dimension) 
  3. OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices for past 15 days (4 × 15 = 60 dimensions)

Total: 1 + 1 + 60 = 62 features(dimensions) per timestamp.



PERFORMANCE HISTORY:
Iteration 0: Baseline - MAPE: 17.25%
  Features: All 62 original features
  DL-Based Feature Importance Analysis:
    • Top important features: Feature_1 (importance=0.0003), Feature_48 (importance=0.0003), Feature_40 (importance=0.0003), Feature_27 (importance=0.0002), Feature_10 (importance=0.0002)




DL-BASED FEATURE IMPORTANCE INSIGHTS FROM BEST MODEL (MAPE: 17.25%):
- Most important features: Feature_1 (importance=0.0003), Feature_48 (importance=0.0003), Feature_40 (importance=0.0003), Feature_27 (importance=0.0002), Feature_10 (importance=0.0002)
- Least important features: Feature_22 (importance=-0.0002), Feature_60 (importance=-0.0002), Feature_30 (importance=-0.0001)






CURRENT TASK (Iteration 1):
Your goal is to create an improved feature engineering function that will achieve better performance than the current best MAPE of 17.25%.

Based on the performance history, DL-based feature importance analysis, and previous code above, analyze what worked and what didn't, then create a new feature engineering approach that:
1. Learns from previous iterations' successes and failures
2. Analyzes the previous code to understand what features were attempted and their effectiveness
3. Builds upon successful feature patterns while avoiding problematic approaches
4. Considers financial domain knowledge (momentum, volatility, volume patterns, etc.)
5. Maintains LSTM-compatible time series structure
6. Uses DL-based feature importance insights to prioritize feature construction
7. Improves upon the previous iteration's approach

Requirements:
1. Write a function called `construct_features` that takes a numpy array of shape (lookback_window, 62) and returns a numpy array of shape (lookback_window, constructed_features)
2. The function should process each timestamp independently but maintain the temporal structure
3. Focus on the most predictive features for each time step, using DL-based feature importance as guidance
4. Consider financial domain knowledge (e.g., price momentum, volatility, volume patterns, etc.)
5. The output should be a 2D numpy array with shape (lookback_window, constructed_features)
6. Include comments explaining your feature engineering choices and how they address previous performance issues and importance insights
7. Make sure the code is production-ready and handles edge cases
8. DO NOT include any import statements - only use numpy (available as 'np') and built-in Python functions
9. The function must return a 2D array where each row represents features for one time step
10. Use numpy nan_to_num to handle NaN values
11. Analyze the previous iteration's code and explain in comments how your approach differs and improves upon it

Please provide ONLY the Python function code, no explanations outside the code comments.
