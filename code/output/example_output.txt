    # 2. Prioritized features based on baseline importance analysis (Feature_60, Feature_22, Feature_37, etc.)
    # 3. Used Garman-Klass volatility estimator which better captures opening jumps than Parkinson's
    # 4. Simplified the short interest momentum calculation for more stability
    # 5. Added normalized short interest using z-scores instead of min-max scaling for better outlier handling
    # 6. Introduced volume spike detection to identify potential short covering events
    # 7. Added short-term price reversal indicator to capture potential turning points
    # 8. Improved trend strength calculation with a more focused time window
    # 9. Added short interest to market activity ratio as a proxy for short interest to float
    # 10. Removed features that showed poor performance in previous iterations
    # 11. Focused on features with clear financial interpretation rather than complex combinations
    # 12. Improved handling of temporal relationships with more appropriate lookback periods
