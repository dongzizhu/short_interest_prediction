# Short Interest Forecasting (JP Morgan Project)

This repository develops a full pipeline to forecast biweekly short interest for U.S. securities and to implement and backtest trading strategies driven by those forecasts. Data originates from FINRAâ€™s Consolidated Short Interest files (biweekly), and is augmented with market data (prices/volumes), shares outstanding/float, and corporate actions to ensure clean, bias-free research.

## Objectives

### Forecasting: 
 - Build models that predict next-period short interest (level or change) and derived metrics (e.g., days-to-cover, short-interest-as-%-of-float).
### Signals: 
 - Convert forecasts into tradable signals with clear, deterministic rules.
### Backtesting: 
 - Evaluate strategies with an event-driven backtester that respects data availability (publication lag), transaction costs, and capacity.
### Reproducibility: 
 - Provide a modular codebase, configuration-driven runs, tests, and versioned data transforms.
