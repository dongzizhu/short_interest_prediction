# Short Interest Forecasting (JP Morgan Project)

This repository develops a full pipeline to forecast biweekly short interest for U.S. securities and to implement and backtest trading strategies driven by those forecasts. Data originates from FINRAâ€™s Consolidated Short Interest files (biweekly), and is augmented with market data (prices/volumes), shares outstanding/float, and corporate actions to ensure clean, bias-free research.
